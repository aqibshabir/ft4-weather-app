# Weather Application

---

> A weather application taking in data from Open Weather Map's API

## Versions

### [v2](https://frolicking-sunshine-c0ab9e.netlify.app/)

In this version(live-demo above) I've implemented the weather API to make a small quiz style game - based on the current weather data around the world. Questions touch on 3 main topics - temperature, wind speed and humidity.

I've taken the previous version and added a toggle menu, in which you can see UK specific weather data as before - stylised now into a widget.

### [v1](https://effulgent-biscochitos-a1337e.netlify.app/)

The first version (live-demo above) is the **bare-bones weather application** that fetches from both; API and from the user's current geolocation (when button clicked). The data that is returned:

1. UK-specific weather data throughout the day (3 hour increments)
2. UK-specific weather data on the next 5 days

### v3?

If I were to develop this further:

1. I'd start by opening up the weather data so that you can view the data for the entire world.

2. I'd add conclusions to the weather data - such as: what it currently feels like or a weather map showing percipitation/wind.

3. I'd also make it so that by clicking certain days - it will dynamically open up specific weather data for that day

4. I'd make improvements to the game. So that at the end of the game, the high score data that I'm currently storing in local storage can be stored under a certain name - adding a leaderboard and possibly a game-over screen.

5. I'd also stylise it more like a weather app, the styling currently looks a bit ambiguous.
