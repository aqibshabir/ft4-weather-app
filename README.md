# Weather Application

---

> A weather application taking in data from Open Weather Map's API

## Version

### [v1](https://effulgent-biscochitos-a1337e.netlify.app/)

The first version (live-demo above) is the **bare-bones weather application** that fetches from both; API and from the user's current geolocation (when button clicked). The data that is returned:

1. UK-specific weather data throughout the day (3 hour increments)
2. UK-specific weather data on the next 5 days

### Thought process for v2

**1:**

I want to make conclusions from the data to give this application depth (for it to do more than just retrieve data from an API).

> A comment to the above point - I am thinking to take this into the direction of a very **basic game** of Higher or Lower. Using broswer API (localstorage) to store a high-score - if possible.

**2:**

Alongside this game, I'd like to present this weather data in a more polished way. That means a responsive design - for phone, tablet and desktops.

**3:**

I'd like to make the weather data interactive using vanilla JS to achieve DOM manipulation to make it a more of an intuitive user experience.

Essentially this app must be more than just a boring weather app - it needs some **personality**!
